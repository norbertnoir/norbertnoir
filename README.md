# Hi, I'm Norbert

### Solo Game Developer | Programmer | 3D Artist | Music Composer

I build unsettling horror games that capture the low-poly aesthetic and nostalgic atmosphere of PSX classics like *Silent Hill* and *Fatal Frame*. As a solo developer, I manage the entire creative pipeline‚Äîfrom C# programming to 3D modeling and sound design‚Äîto deliver a complete, cohesive vision.
